### Remove Duplicates from SortArray

#### 描述

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.+

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
For example, Given input array A = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

#### 描述

Follow up for "Remove Duplicates": What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
For example, given sorted array A = [1,1,1,2,2,3], your function should return length = 5, and A is now [1,1,2,2,3]

### Longest Consecutive Sequence

#### 描述

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.+

For example, Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

### Two Sum

#### 描述

Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.+

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2

### 3Sum

#### 描述

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.+

Note:
Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a≤b≤c)
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4}.
A solution set is:
(-1, 0, 1)
(-1, -1, 2)

#### 解答

### 3Sum Closest

#### 描述

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
